## Project Scope

The TTF repo contains all of the artifacts for each component that can be used to create a token specification. It also contains tools and an object model that are used to create more sophisticated business level applications for various platforms to design tokens.

Artifacts are made up of a collection of files that can be viewed using a one artifact per page web app that is hosted here and requires no application infrastructure to be stood up to support.

Contributors can choose to modify the artifact's JSON files directly or use some of the applications listed below to stand up local or hosted infrastructure that will provide access to the object model via a gRpc service.

The contents of this repo contain the Token Taxonomy Framework (TTF) comprised of the following:

- [Taxonomy Overview](token-taxonomy.md) - overview and taxonomy syntax and definitions used to create artifacts that conform to the taxonomy.
- [Taxonomy Model](taxonomy-model.md) - technical overview of the model used to interact with the taxonomy using tools or to integrate into custom applications.
- [Control Messages](token-control-messages.md) - base control message descriptions
- [Taxonomy Artifact Format](taxonomy-artifact-format.md) - instructions and format rules for creating taxonomy artifacts.
- [Artifacts](artifacts) - starting artifacts for base token types and a handful of common behaviors and a single behavior group.  These are samples/template artifacts.
