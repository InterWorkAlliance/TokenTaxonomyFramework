      "businessExample": "A GHG/Carbon removal or sequestration activity can differ between ecological projects as to certain net-negativity attributes:  Additionality - The principle that a project activity is additional if the resulting emission reductions are lower than what would have happened in the absence of the activity; Durability - The term in years of how long the CO2 will be removed from the atmosphere, compared with the risk of CO2 reversion to the atmosphere before that term elapses; Leakage - A decrease in sequestration or an increase in emissions outside the boundaries of project, program activities resulting from project, and/or program implementation. Leakage may be caused by shifting of the activities of people present in the project area or by market effects whereby emission reductions are countered by emissions created by shifts in supply of and demand for the products and services affected by the project; Clear Removals - Are either clearly 100% removals (afforestation-reforestation) or are ex-post verified as removal volumes according to a published MRV methodology.",
