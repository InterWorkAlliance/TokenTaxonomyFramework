      "businessDescription": "A token class that implements this behavior is burned or retired with its value being applied to offset another balance. For example, a Carbon Credit can be used to offset a carbon emission to achieve emissions goals like net zero; a 1 mtCO2e emission can be offset by applying a 1mtCO2e credit. The process of applying a credit to lower an emission is called offsetting. This behavior extends the traditional burn or retire behavior by requiring an offset target id so that the token being offset is correlated with the appropriate emission. Once a token is offset, it can no longer be used.",
