For example, a Processed Carbon Benefit Claim is created after validation and verification of an Ecological Claim and a Carbon Credit is created as a result. Once the credit is created, the Processed Claim token should be credited or retired by passing in the credit that resulted from the verification of the claim. This ensures that the processed claim cannot be validated and verified again and can no longer be used.",
